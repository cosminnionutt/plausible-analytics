# Code of Conduct

Plausible, both the open-source project and the company that develops it, pledges to be a community with a healthy and friendly environment. What follows is a set of guidelines on how we get there.


## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and direct feedback, as well as offering it in that spirit.
* Assuming good intentions. Approaching work relationships with a default of trust and positivity.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Any form of discrimination and harassment. Particularly on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

The community leaders at this time are:
* Marko Saric (marko@plausible.io)
* Uku Taht (uku@plausible.io)

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Depending on the severity of the offense and the findings of the investigation, the response may include private warning, a ban from the community, or even termination for contractors and employees. The reactive measures taken will be shared with the reporting member of the community when possible.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
